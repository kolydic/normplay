things coming: 

* the inside-nemesis: Crustyfoot the Phenomenon 
-- a level where laura must navigate the matrix of life circumstances that link to the crustyfoot phenomenon 

crustyfoot the phenomenon (CtP for short) is a network of wounds, experiences, and beliefs about oneself 
it is a thicket ambling across the page, and laura gets swept up in it. you can't get to the door, you can't move, 
because you are tangled in it. 

how do you get out? 
after a moment, a text box appears. it asks you questions and you have to answer them 
there are "right answers" ?? maybe. or at least, minimum length answers, you really have to dig in. 
or something like that. 
addressing the beliefs in order to mitigate the power of the wounds 
questions might be: 
    is laura worthy of love? 
    are you? 

as the questions get answered, the density of the connections becomes thinner, and laura can snap through them one at a time until she is free. 
it settles into a garden and grows into things 

* passages per strategy 

* capacity to reveal Logic Bits 



changes: 

* remove each of the three point objects for saint,  asshole, and "what are you even doing" quadrants of the grid 

* move the anxious point up more 

* make the anxious point have text to the right of the point in #ff4444 that reads "=L."

* when Laura hovers over "A represents B", what currently comes up as "placeholder" should read: "A wants to stop defining wellness(A) as a function of [B represents A]. <br> STRATEGY: <br>reduce frequency of [A represents B]. <br><br>  * will reduce frequency of [A represents B] altogether."  

* while the above text is showing, the a keypress of * will make appear a bar that is like, a little rectangle, and the left 2/3 is filled Grey, the right 1/3 has no fill. Then in 1.5 seconds the rectangle will appear instead as the left 1/3 filled Grey, the right 2/3 has no fill. Then a black box pops up with white text that reads: "SOLUTION NOT ACHIEVED. Even though A represents B less, the dependency on representations of A from actors other than A is generalized."

Because actually this is a lot harder than it sounds? So like, how? <br><br> If A represents [B represents A] less frequently, this entails both fewer thoughts of self and fewer thoughts of others. Go in that space, see what it looks like."

* only once the player has attempted both strategies (pressed * under both of the above conditions, the door appears. Before then, it isn't visible
