things coming: 



* the inside-nemesis: Crustyfoot the Phenomenon 
-- a level where laura must navigate the matrix of life circumstances that link to the crustyfoot phenomenon 

crustyfoot the phenomenon (CtP for short) is a network of wounds, experiences, and beliefs about oneself 
it is a thicket ambling across the page, and laura gets swept up in it. you can't get to the door, you can't move, 
because you are tangled in it. 

how do you get out? 
after a moment, a text box appears. it asks you questions and you have to answer them 
there are "right answers" ?? maybe. or at least, minimum length answers, you really have to dig in. 
or something like that. 
addressing the beliefs in order to mitigate the power of the wounds 
questions might be: 
    is laura worthy of love? 
    are you? 


how does "shadow-laura" manifest here? 
maybe on some other level page laura randomly wonders "why are my feet so crusty" 

as the questions get answered, the density of the connections becomes thinner, and laura can snap through them one at a time until she is free. 
it settles into a garden and grows into things 

* passages per strategy 

* capacity to reveal Logic Bits 


A doesn't need to represent B represnting A less, 
A needs to amplify whenever B represents A positively 

    at a certain point we need to revisit the strategy list. laura realizes her model is incomplete. 
    the new model has weights for each term and when you hover over each, there are sub-models 

    one of the terms should represent [B represents A] which is made up of (a*(B_positive_behavior) + b*(A_negative_behavior) ) * noise factor 
                                                                                B_positive_behavior = B_behavior + A_interpretation 
                                                                                    same for negative 

                STRATEGY: increase a 

        


to do: 
* what is up with the logic for why the currently available strategies are ineffective? they don't really make sense 
* ok actually [A represents B] should not have its own hover 
 all strategies become accessible engaging with [A represents B representing A] 

when laura engages w/ ABA, the branch of model terms appear below. with subterms coming off like fractals 
i think the complexity could be represented by having too many terms overlapping with each other so that as you get deeper, they all overlap and become illegible
every strategy fails for the same reason: actually B has nothing to do with the solution. we need to think about the generalized solutions in the mind of laura. 
    so let's go into laura's mind about this at a deeper level 
        --> maze 



* make the "clue" for Engage via enter key clearer in the instructions 


* ferny can change/add dots here: addStaticDots() in maze_script.js 
    check that dots as labeled here are not refrenced by labels elsewhere, or update there if new 



the layers of selves visual (face in the face). what layers of self are being engaged and connected between A and B with each strategy 
how are they being tethered 
    ^^ sidequest to A-B dynamics? 
    ok yeah we're exploring these solutions that don't have anything to do with B really bc it's about laura and her self, but 
    what happens with B? like that still matters? 
        cursor laura brings this up 
        the site-overlord is like "ok laura. sure we can go there a minute" 

    layers of self: the inner self, the protective self, the child self
